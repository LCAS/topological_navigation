Bayesian Topological Localisation
======================

This package provides support for localising agents in a topological map, based on `topological_navigation`. 

It uses particle filter for performing state estimation. It uses continuous-time Hidden Markov Models as the prediction model.

The code exploits the fact that generally a topological map nodes are sparsely connected - particles can only jump from a node to another if they are connected through an edge - to perform the computation efficiently.  

# How to use

## Launching topological localisation

This node assumes that `topological_navigation` is running, in particular check that 
1. the topological map is loaded in the DB 
2. the `topological_map_manager` is running.

Launch localisation node with:

```
roslaunch bayesian_topological_localisation topological_localisation.launch
```

## Registering a new agent to localise

The node provide the service `/bayesian_topological_localisation/localise_agent` To register a new agent.

The srv is:

```
# constants for selecting the policy on how to spread the particles when the localisation starts 
uint8 CLOSEST_NODE=0       # all particles to closest node 
uint8 SPREAD_UNIFORM=1     # particles spread uniformly around all ndoes
uint8 FOLLOW_OBS=2         # use the distribution of the first observation

# constants for the prediction model to use
uint8 PRED_CTMC=0          # continuous-time hidden markov model
uint8 PRED_IDENTITY=1      # each particle remains in the same node it was previously

string name                         # identifier of the agent to track
uint64 n_particles                  # number of particle to use 
uint8 initial_spread_policy         # policy value, one of the above constants
uint8 prediction_model              # prediction model, one of above constants 
bool do_prediction                  # if to perform prediction steps when observations are not available
float64 prediction_rate             # rate at which predictions are performed
float64 prediction_speed_decay      # the last estimated speed from observations will be multiplied by this factor at every estimation step until a new observation is received and the speed is estimated again. If 1.0, speed remains constant.

---

bool success                        # true if the registration of new agent localisation was successful
```

## Stop localising agent

Call the service `/bayesian_topological_localisation/stop_localise`, with srv:
```
string name         # identifier for the agent

---

bool success        # true if the localisation is stopped 
```

## Sending observations

The localisation node needs observations in order to localise and agent - e.g. `robot_1` - on the map.  
There are two ways an observation can be provided listed below. Each type of observation can be provided through a topic or by calling a service. If calling the service you will get the localisation result straight away in your service response.

### 1. Pose with covariance 
- **topic modality**: To be published to topic `/robot_1/pose_obs` (msg type `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped`). The message has to provide a pose (x, y) and a variance for the pose as a covariance matrix: 
   ```
   [var_x,   0  ,  0, 0, 0, 0,
      0  , var_y,  0, 0, 0, 0,
      0  ,   0  ,  0, 0, 0, 0, 
      0  ,   0  ,  0, 0, 0, 0, 
      0  ,   0  ,  0, 0, 0, 0, 
      0  ,   0  ,  0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
- **service modality**: Call `/robot_1/update_pose_obs` (srv type `bayesian_topological_localisation/UpdatePoseObservation`), the request parameter `pose` is a `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped` and has to be filled as for the topic modality.

### 2. Likelihood
- **topic modality**: To be published to topic `/robot_1/likelihood_obs` (msg type `bayesian_topological_localisation/DistributionStamped`). The message has to contain a list of nodes names with a list of values for the likelihood, one for each node. The message does not need to contain all the nodes in the map, the one that have a likelihood non-zero are sufficient. Note that in order to predict the future agent position the model estimates the velocity vector of the agent from pose observations only, hence if you use only likelihood type observations please implement your own prediction model.
  
- **service modality**: Call `/robot_1/update_likelihood_obs` (srv type `bayesian_topological_localisation/UpdateLikelihoodObservation`), the request parameter `likelihood` is a `bayesian_topological_localisation/DistributionStamped` and has to be filled as for the topic modality.
  
## Getting localisation result

The node position for an agent - e.g. `robot_1` - that is being localised is published latch to topic `/robot_1/estimated_node`. The package also provides the probability distribution of the agent location published latch to topic `/robot_1/current_prob_dist` as a list of nodes and with their corresponding probability.

## Visualizations

In order to visualize the localisation result - for agent `robot_1` for example - on rviz add:
- a `Marker` attached to topic `/robot_1/estimated_node_viz`
- a `MarkerArray` attached to topic `/robot_1/particles_viz` 

## TODO
- [ ] change the $\lambda$ paramenter is computed in the ctmm prediction model, particles jumps too much if distance between nodes is unequal
- [x] implement prediction model to spread to closeby nodes
- [x] implement services for sending obs & getting results, for receiving predictions
- [x] implement use of `prediction_speed_decay`, now always constant speed
- [x] correctly stop the threads on shutdown request
- [x] default particles number if not provided
- [ ] ~~implement use of `initial_spread_policy`, now just uses the first observation~~
- [ ] ~~allow to use different state estimation methods than just particle filters. A simple one is needed for localising robots from the metric localisation, i.e. replace this https://github.com/LCAS/topological_navigation/blob/master/topological_navigation/scripts/localisation.py .~~
