1.0.7 (2018-10-26)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#354 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/354>`_ from gpdas/indigo-devel
  tmap to yaml  - adding meta info to nodes
* Code cleanup
  Minor cleanup in usage information printing
* tmap to yaml export - adding meta info to nodes
  When a yaml file is created from a tmap, it misses some tags and so is not as per the (yaml) format for topological map. So a yaml file exported from tmap cannot be imported to mongodb.
  A small fix is done by adding some meta tag to the objects in the yaml file
* Contributors: Jaime Pulido Fentanes, gpdas

1.0.6 (2018-07-17)
------------------

1.0.5 (2018-04-17)

------------------
* Modifications to topological map tools to accommodate topological map editor (`#345 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/345>`_)
  * fix weird space-colon
  * Easier translational movement of waypoints, generic node field updater
  Moving the waypoints that are displayed in the topological map in rviz is now
  easier - just uses 2D planar motion as opposed to multiple handles for the x and
  y dimensions.
  Added a function which calls into the database to update any property of a node.
  * Fixed not loading map after update, correctly updates edges on node rename
  This should really not be the file being used - it seems like the one in util is
  used to change things and as such is more up to date.
  * remove unnecessary if
  * update function for edge action and top_vel
  * add deprecation warnings to topological_map.py - should use manager.py instead
  * start on work to make manager services more useful for modifying map
  * add callback for getting tags for a specific node
  * partial switch to the using manager, updating and adding tags
  * fix message fields and add messages to generation
  * small script to insert empty map into a database
  * add edge removal service
  * change callbacks so that functions can be called without service

  Now when creating the topological map from a waypoint file it will add a
  Charging node (ChargingPoint) at position {0,0,0,0,0,0,0}

  be conected to the first waypoint in the file only using the
  docking action
